    <h2>More on Pav Bhaji</h2>
    <p>Pav bhaji is an iconic dish from Mumbai and hugely popular all over India as a street food.

        In Hindi and Marathi languages, the word “Pav” is for bread rolls. “Bhaji” means vegetables or a vegetable based dish (dry or gravy) in the Marathi language. Since both the bhaji (vegetable gravy) and pav (dinner rolls) are served together, hence the name &ldquo;Pav Bhaji&ldquor;.

        <li>1 cup of green peas</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>2 large green chile peppers, chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pav bhaji masala, or to taste</li>

        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour 2 cups water into the bottom of a pressure cooker. Place a trivet into the pressure cooker and turn the heat on high. Add potatoes, and green peas in a single layer in the pressure cooker and lock the lid.</li>
        <li>Cook over high heat until the pressure regulator reaches 15 psi, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Allow pressure to drop naturally, 10 minutes. Unlock and remove lid. Remove vegetables and smash.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, grind ginger-garlic paste and green chile peppers together in a mortar and pestle until well mashed together.</li>
        Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and fry cumin seeds until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add garlic-chili paste and saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Add finely chopped onions and cook until soft and lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Continue to cook until soft, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and a little water.
        <li>Simmer over low heat until mixture thickens, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with pav bhaji masala and a little chili powder.</li>
        <li>Stir in boiled smashed vegetables and simmer until flavors meld, about 10 minutes. Season with salt to taste and serve sprinkled with fresh cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
